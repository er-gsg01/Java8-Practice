Q. Difference between method overloading and overriding?
Ans : Both are concept of polymorphism. Method overloading is a form of static binding. Method overriding is
 a form dynamic binding. Overloading is applied in single class, but overriding is applicable for inherited class.
 Method overloading is always specific to method signature. 
It defines number of parameter, type of parameter and sequence of parameter.

Q:- what is subString method working.? will it create new string or not.?

====================================================
Q:- what is diff between split and subString() method.?
Ans :-  String [] Split(regx):-
       ----------------------
	   It is used for  making the String  content in to multiple parts based on the specified character or word as the delimiter on all occurence.
	   
	   String [] Split(String str,int limt):=
	   -------------------------------------
      It is used for  making the String  content in to multiple parts based on the specified character or word as the delimiter up to the limit value occurence.
	  If limit value is with in the range then as per the limit only it will stop the spliting.
	  if we provide the limit value as <1 ans >no of occurence i.e out of range of occurencethen it will do normal spliting of the String content.
	  ================================================
	  subString():-
	  ------------
	  it is newly defined method in string class which is used for displaying the specified part of string content.

Q:- I want to get repeated word in from string.?
Ans:- 
   import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map; 
    import java.util.Scanner;
 
// How to find repeated/duplicated words in a string using Java
public class DuplicateWords {
     
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Enter string to analyse:");
        Scanner sn = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = sn.nextLine();
         
        // first let us split string into words
        String[] words = input.split(" ");
         
        // adds all words into a map
        // we also check whether the word is already in map!
        Map<String,String> wordMap = new HashMap<String,String>();
        for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++) {
            String word = words[i].toUpperCase(); // for case insensitive comparison
            if(wordMap.get(word)!=null) {
                // we found a duplicated word!
                System.out.println("Duplicated/Repeated word:"+word);
            }else {
                wordMap.put(word, word);
            }
        }
    }   
}

If a word is repeated more than once, it is printed multiple times. The following program fixes this by keeping track of 
printed words using another map.

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;
 
// How to find repeated/duplicated words in a string using Java
public class DuplicateWords2 {
     
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Enter string to analyse:");
        Scanner sn = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = sn.nextLine();
         
        // first let us split string into words
        String[] words = input.split(" ");
         
        // adds all words into a map
        // we also check whether the word is already in map!
        Map<String,String> wordMap = new HashMap<String,String>();                
        Map<String,String> printedMap = new HashMap<String,String>();
 
        for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++) {
            String word = words[i].toUpperCase(); // for case insensitive comparison
            if(wordMap.get(word)!=null) {
                // we found a duplicated word!
                if(printedMap.get(word)==null) { // first check if it is printed already!
                    System.out.println("Duplicated/Repeated word:"+word);
                    printedMap.put(word, word); 
                }
            }else {
                wordMap.put(word, word);
            }
        }
    }
     
}

Q:- What is inner class .? have you used inner class in your application.?(interested about real time sineario)
Ans:- from copy mam notes.
===========================================
Q:-what is immutable class.?
Ans:- Once we created an object we can't perform any changes in the existing object.
If we are trying to perform any changes with those changes a new object will be created.
If there is no change in the content then existing object will be reused. This behavior is
called immutability. Example String class

==========================================================
Q:- what is abstraction how to implement.?
Ans:- page 187 pdf
==================================
Q:- what wil happen if donot have any abstract method class.?
Ans:- Declaring a class abstract only means that you don't allow it to be instantiated on its own.
Declaring a method abstract means that subclasses have to provide an implementation for that method.
The two are separate concepts, though obviously you can't have an abstract method in a non-abstract class.
 You can even have abstract classes with final methods but never the other way around.
==================================================================
Q:- how to move string from string pool to heap area .?
Ans:- You can't move a String Literal from String Pool to Heap.

String pool is basically a cache for Strings inside the Heap only. 
When you use a String literal like "Hello" it is interned i.e. its String Object is moved to the String pool , 
any further reference to "Hello" is pointing to the same String object present in String Pool.
So 
 String a = "Java";
 String b = "Java";
=> a, b refer to the same object from String Pool area.
If we try,
 String f =  new String("Java");
=> It creates a new Object in Heap. So new memory space.

You can not move a String Literal from String Pool to Heap, but you can move a String Object from Heap to the Pool by 
calling intern() method of java.lang.String class.

=========================================================
Q:- method of object creation.?
Ans:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-create-objects-java/
===============================================================
Q:- finalise method().?
ANS:- finalize is a method, always invoked by Garbage Collector just before destroying
an object to perform cleanup activities.
======================================
Q:- super () and this() in constructor.?
ANs:- super()- calls the base class constructor whereas
this()- calls current class constructor.
Both this() and super() are constructor calls.
Constructor call must always be the first statement. So we can not have two statements as first statement, 
hence either we can call super() or we can call this() from the constructor, but not both.
===============================================
Q:- interface variable.?
Ans:- Interface variables are static because Java interfaces cannot be instantiated in their own right; the value of the variable
 must be assigned in a static context in which no instance exists. 
The final modifier ensures the value assigned to the interface variable is a true constant that cannot be re-assigned by program code.
========================================================
Q:- can we have final constructor.?
Ans:- 
No Constructors can NEVER be declared as final. Your compiler will always give an error of the type "modifier final not allowed" Final, 
when applied to methods, means that the method cannot be overridden in a subclass. Constructors are NOT ordinary methods. 
(different rules apply) Additionally, Constructors are NEVER inherited. So there is NO SENSE in declaring it final
